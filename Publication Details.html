						<h2><B>Smart Sitting Position and Energy Management Device: An Arduino-based Solution for
								Improved Health and Sustainable Electricity Consumption</B></h2>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p>The correct way to sit at a table is abundantly repeated for everyone and all of us are aware of it.
					In practice, however, these positions are not followed. Most people sit relaxed and slump or put
					their feet on the table, which damages their spine, neck, and even reduces their concentration and
					performance. On the other hand, high electricity consumption in proportion to its production rate
					causes intermittent interruptions on the hot days of the year, and on the other side of view,
					electricity production in many countries is based on non-renewable resources. Therefore, it would
					certainly help to develop a device to control the userâ€™s sitting correct position that also reduces
					power consumption in order to manage ambient light is practical and useful. To build it, we used an
					Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, light detection, and a relay and lamp which makes it efficient,
					easy to use, and reasonably priced. As a result, by placing the ultrasonic sensors in front of the
					user's legs and face in the correct position, our device controlled the user's position. And by
					placing the light detection sensor in the environment and measuring the amount of light, our device
					controlled the power consumption. In this way, if the user is not in the proper position or there is
					enough ambient light, the lamp will turn off. And if the user position is correct and the light is
					low, the lamp will light up.</p>
