				<h2>Before University</h2>
				<p>I was Born in 1999 in Khomin, Markazi Province, Iran. I had the opportunity to showcase my
					exceptional
					talents during high school by successfully passing the entrance exam of the <strong>National Organization
					for Development of Exceptional Talents</strong> (commonly known as SAMPAD). As a result, I earned my math and
					physics diploma from this
					distinguished institution, achieving an impressive score of 17.20 out of 20. Subsequently, I
					successfully passed the entrance exam for the <a href="https://ui.ac.ir/EN">University of
						Isfahan.</a>, one of Iran's prestigious state-funded
					universities, where I pursued my studies in the field of computer engineering.
				</p>


				<h2>My Bachelor's Journey</h2>
				<p>During the process of selecting my university field, I lacked a clear and accurate understanding of
					the available options. Consequently, I made a decision based on an incomplete view of the fields and
					the job market prospects after graduation, leading me to choose computer engineering. However, upon
					entering the university, I didn't feel a strong interest in this field, and I found myself grappling
					with confusion about my true passions.It was not until I discovered the specialization of computer
					architecture that I finally found my
					genuine interest and enthusiasm. From that point on, everything changed. I became deeply engaged and
					motivated, which resulted in achieving exceptional grades in all the specialized courses related to
					this field.</p>

				<h2>Other Interests and Hobbies</h2>
				<p>From my earliest memories, I have been encouraged by the continuous support of my parents to engage
					in various non-academic activities, which allowed me to lead a well-rounded life alongside my
					studies. Among these activities, art played an important role, and I thoroughly enjoyed attending
					classes on oil painting and calligraphy. Additionally, I also explored my interests in sports,
					participating in classes for karate, swimming, and volleyball.<br>I initially started with swimming, and as I delved into the sport, I found a genuine interest in it.
					Later, I decided to pursue volleyball more seriously. These choices brought about several
					achievements at the provincial, national, and collegiate levels in both sports. These experiences
					have positively impacted my life, instilling qualities like discipline, perseverance, and a drive
					for excellence that have shaped my character and approach to challenges.</p>
