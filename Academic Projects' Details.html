				<!-- <h2>Before University</h2>
				<p>I was Born in 1999 in Khomin, Markazi Province, Iran. I had the opportunity to showcase my
					exceptional
					talents during high school by successfully passing the entrance exam of the <strong>National Organization
					for Development of Exceptional Talents</strong> (commonly known as SAMPAD). As a result, I earned my math and
					physics diploma from this
					distinguished institution, achieving an impressive score of 17.20 out of 20. Subsequently, I
					successfully passed the entrance exam for the <a href="https://ui.ac.ir/EN">University of
						Isfahan.</a>, one of Iran's prestigious state-funded
					universities, where I pursued my studies in the field of computer engineering.
				</p>


				<h2>My Bachelor's Journey</h2>
				<p>During the process of selecting my university field, I lacked a clear and accurate understanding of
					the available options. Consequently, I made a decision based on an incomplete view of the fields and
					the job market prospects after graduation, leading me to choose computer engineering. However, upon
					entering the university, I didn't feel a strong interest in this field, and I found myself grappling
					with confusion about my true passions.It was not until I discovered the specialization of computer
					architecture that I finally found my
					genuine interest and enthusiasm. From that point on, everything changed. I became deeply engaged and
					motivated, which resulted in achieving exceptional grades in all the specialized courses related to
					this field.</p>

				<h2>Other Interests and Hobbies</h2>
				<p>From my earliest memories, I have been encouraged by the continuous support of my parents to engage
					in various non-academic activities, which allowed me to lead a well-rounded life alongside my
					studies. Among these activities, art played an important role, and I thoroughly enjoyed attending
					classes on oil painting and calligraphy. Additionally, I also explored my interests in sports,
					participating in classes for karate, swimming, and volleyball.<br>I initially started with swimming, and as I delved into the sport, I found a genuine interest in it.
					Later, I decided to pursue volleyball more seriously. These choices brought about several
					achievements at the provincial, national, and collegiate levels in both sports. These experiences
					have positively impacted my life, instilling qualities like discipline, perseverance, and a drive
					for excellence that have shaped my character and approach to challenges.</p> -->

							Arduino-based Solution for Improved Health and Sustainable Electricity
							Consumption<i>(Final Thesis)</i></b>
						<p><b>Details: </b> In this final bachelor's thesis project, we utilized an Arduino board along
							with ultrasonic sensors, a temperature sensor, a lamp, relay, and LEDs to improve the user's
							reading and sitting environment. By detecting the user's position with ultrasonic sensors,
							we prompted them to correct their posture by automatically turning off the lamp using the
							relay. Moreover, we incorporated a temperature sensor to monitor the environment, and if it
							became too hot or too cold, we alerted the user through the LEDs. This innovative system
							provided a comfortable and conducive environment for reading and sitting, enhancing the
							overall user experience effectively.

							efficient LED management. The web page provides a straightforward interface, enabling users
							to conveniently control the LED's activation and deactivation duration.

							and 2 dimensional matrices<i>(Hardware Software Co-Design)</i></b>
						<p><b>Details: </b> The software description for calculating determinants of 1 and 2-dimensional
							matrices involved implementing the relevant codes in the C language. As for the hardware
							description of determinants for matrices with 3 dimensions and above, a control unit was
							designed as a Finite State Machine (FSM). Subsequently, this FSM was implemented using
							Ghezel, along with its corresponding DataPath. This approach allowed for efficient
							computation and representation of determinants, providing a comprehensive solution for both

							Management<i>(Computer Aided Design Tools Lab)</i></b>
						<p><b>Details: </b>Adjacent to each door, a person detection sensor is positioned, which
							activates a signal for one hour upon detecting people nearby. The system operates as
							follows: If someone presses the entrance door button, the door will only open if the total
							number of people inside is below 15. On the other hand, if a person presses the exit door
							button and happens to be the sole individual in the room, the door will automatically close
							upon their exit, leaving the room empty. Throughout the duration when the input door remains
							open, a signal indicating its open status is set to 1. Conversely, when the output door is
							closed, a signal indicating its closed status is set to 0. This setup ensures efficient and
							automated control of the doors based on the number of occupants inside the room.

							Line<i>(Industrial Automation Lab)</i></b>
						<p><b>Details: </b>In this project, we aim to produce raw materials from two sources: green and
							blue materials. These materials will be merged using the Pop Up Wheel Sorter, forming a
							combined path leading to the Machining Center machine. The machine transforms these
							materials into base or lid components, which are then sent through an output path to the
							Pick & Place device. This device efficiently separates them by color and directs them into
							two separate paths for storage. The blue lids and bases are stored using Stacker Crane 2,
							while Stacker Crane 1 handles the storage of the green lids and bases.
